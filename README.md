Mastermind is a code-breaking game played between two players, where one player is the code-maker and the other is the code-breaker. The game consists of a board with a row of holes, and each hole can be filled with one of several colored pegs.

The code-maker secretly selects a pattern of four colored pegs and places them in a row on the board, hidden from the code-breaker. The code-breaker then tries to guess the pattern, by placing colored pegs in the holes and receiving feedback from the code-maker after each guess.

After each guess, the code-maker provides feedback to the code-breaker in the form of two types of pegs:

Red pegs: One red peg is given for each peg in the guess that is the correct color and in the correct position in the code.

White pegs: One white peg is given for each peg in the guess that is the correct color but in the wrong position in the code.

The code-breaker then uses the feedback to make another guess, and the game continues until the code-breaker correctly guesses the code, or uses all the possible tries, which are 12.

THIS PARTICULAR VERSION has to modes available for the player.
- code-breaker mode
- code-maker mode

In the code-breaker game mode trying to brake computers code using colored pegs and placing them on the line in the positions from 1 to 4. Recieving hints after each round for guidens.

In the code-maker mode user creates a code of 4 digits and computer trying to crack it with in 8 rounds with the tailored algorithms.


I am building Mastermind game to practise OOP consept with Ruby language.

The game is played in the command line.
